# aws-python
group of python scripts that make use of aws cli

Hello! 

I wanted to store some python scripts that make use of the aws cli API and share them with the community. These are mainly geared towards account auditing. But may expand beyong that in the future. There might already be a set of scripts out there that accomplish the same things I'm working on, however, as a learning experience I thought it would be fun to write my own. 


aws_access_key_report.py - python script that creates a html report on user accounts access keys and password age. Access keys are greater than a year old are highlited in red.
